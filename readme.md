# Ander Worm
<sub>Developed by [Fernando Falat](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fernandofalat/), [Henrique Galeski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/henriquegaleski/), and [Juan Harbar Penas](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jhpenas/), for [NASA Space Apps Challenge 2023](https://www.spaceappschallenge.org/).</sub>



This project created a digital twin of the C. elegans worm, offering a simulation of its behavior and genetics. Key features include genome mapping, behavioral analysis, physiological modeling, data visualization, machine learning integration, and collaborative tools. This digital twin accelerates research on C. elegans by providing a virtual experimentation environment with advanced data analysis capabilities.

## PROJECT DETAILS
The project involves the development of a Streamlit application using Python to create a digital twin for the C. elegans worm. This digital twin offers a simulation of the worm's behavior and genetics, providing researchers with a powerful tool for in-depth analysis. Its primary goal is to facilitate the analysis of how space variables impact the worm without the need for new physical assays in space.

### How does it work?

The application simulates the C. elegans worm's behavior and genetic makeup. Researchers can input specific space variables, such as radiation levels, gravity conditions, or temperature, into the simulation. The digital twin then models how these variables may affect the worm's physiology and behavior based on existing research and data.

The diagram below illustrates the Streamlit application development process.

### Benefits:

Space Research Facilitation: The project streamlines the analysis of the impact of space variables on the C. elegans worm, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming physical assays in space.
Cost and Time Savings: Researchers can conduct virtual experiments and data analysis, reducing the resource-intensive nature of traditional space-based research.
Insights into Space Biology: The application provides valuable insights into how space conditions affect gene expression and the behavior of C. elegans, contributing to our understanding of space biology.
### Tools and Technologies:

Programming Language: Python
Framework: Streamlit
Preliminar Data Analysis Tool: GEO2R
By using Python and Streamlit, the project offers a user-friendly interface for researchers (shown in the figure below) to input variables, visualize simulations, and analyze results. Overall, the project leverages software and data analysis tools to bridge the gap between space research and biology, making it more accessible and efficient.
