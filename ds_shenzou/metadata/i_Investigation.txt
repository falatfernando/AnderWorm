Study Title	"Synergistic effects of microgravity and space radiation (Nimblegen)"
Study Description	"Space radiations and microgravity both could cause DNA damage in cells, but the effects of microgravity on DNA damage response to space radiations are still controversial. A mRNA microarray and microRNA microarray in dauer larvae of Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) that endured spaceflight environment and space radiations environment during 16.5-day Shenzhou-8 space mission were performed. In our study, wild type, dys-1 mutant and ced-1 mutant strains of C.elegans endured four conditions during shenzhou-8 spaceflight mission, including spaceflight static condition(ss), spaceflight 1-g centrifugal condition(sc), ground control condition(gc) and no-transport control. Limited to the quantity of worm samples, we performed technical-repeat test but not sample-repeat test.Accordingly, 12 mRNA microarrays were performed."

Study Protocol Description	"Shenzhou-8 was launched in the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center on 1 November 2011. About 10 h before the launch, fresh solid NGM and approximately 100,000 dauer worms were successively loaded in the containers.Containers were settled into the centrifugal and static slots of BIOBOX. The Shenzhou-8 mission was flown from 1 - 17 November 2011, with a total mission time of 16.5 days. Throughout the duration of the experiment, the containers maintained a temperature of 23+/- 0.5C. G-force peaks did not exceed levels of 0.01 g, while most of the time values oscillated between 0.005 g. Space radiations dose was measured in the static slot (1.92 mGy) and centrifuge slot (2.27 mGy), respectively. Seven hours after landing, worms were collected and kept in liquid nitrogen. The corresponding ground controls of the experiment were performed in parallel at the Payload Integration Test Center in Beijing 2 days later. Here, the samples were kept in a static slot in BIOBOX and temperature was maintained at 23 +/-0.5C. The ground group was stopped after 16.5 days and the samples were collected after 7 h later. Worms were cultured on Nematode Growth Medium (NGM) at 23C and synchronized to dauer larvae by 1% sodium dodecyl sulfonate (SDS) (Sangon Biotec, Shanghai, China) according to the protocols in Wormbook (Stiernagle 2006)."	"Total RNA was isolated using Invitrogen TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Total RNA was quantified using a NanoDrop-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher, Wilmington, DE, USA) and RNA quality monitored by GelDoc-ItTM 310 Imaging System (UVP, Cambridge, CA, EUA)."	"For Cy3 labeling of cDNA, the NimbleGen One-Color DNA labeling kit was used according to the manufacturer's guideline detailed in the Gene Expression Analysis protocol (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA)."	"Microarrays were hybridized at 42C during 16 to 20h with 4 ug of Cy3 labeled ds-cDNA in NimbleGen hybridization buffer/ hybridization component A in a hybridization chamber (Hybridization System - NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA). Following hybridization, washing was performed using the NimbleGen Wash Buffer kit (NimbleGen Systems, Inc., Madison, WI, USA)."	"Slides were scanned at 5 um/pixel resolution using an Axon GenePix 4000 B scanner (Molecular Devices Corporation) piloted by GenePix Pro 6.0 software (Axon)."	"Scanned images (TIFF format) were imported into NimbleScan software (version 2.5) for grid alignment and expression data analysis. Expression data were normalized through quantile normalization and the Robust Multichip Average (RMA) algorithm included in the NimbleScan software."
